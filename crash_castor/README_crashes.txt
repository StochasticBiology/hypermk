castor's fit_mk crashes sometimes. This happens at least with the cross.sectional.cross example and the single.uncertain example, all of them using optim (not nlminb) as optimizer.

In all cases, this happens in runs with Ntrials > 1 (with Ntrials = 1, I have not been able to replicate it after using more than two thousand random seed starts). The trial that crashes is, in the examples I've seen, one with index > 1; so it seems that with Ntrials > 1 the place where optimization starts searching for can lead something astray (but this is just a wild guess).


What is in here: R files and their corresponding Rout that reproduce the crash (in my system, using Linux and gcc). I set verbose and debugg to TRUE.


This whole thing is unfortunate, because it precludes running fit_mk with Ntrials > 1 and optim (optim is much faster than nlminb in most cases I've tried)

Examples included:
==================

- crash_cross.sectional.cross_plain : the cross.sectional.cross example

- crash_cross.sectional.cross_larger_N: like the cross.sectional.cross example, but the data contains more rows of observation (the final "m" used is generated by randomly adding rows from the original "m")


- crash_single.uncertain.example_1: single.uncertain, Nthreads = 1.
(running that same example with Nthreads = 5 also crashes it)

- crash_single.uncertain.example_2: single.uncertain, Nthreads = 1. Like previous, but different seed. (I edit the Rout to save space).
